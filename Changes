Changes
=======

v0.5.2 - 08 Dec 2017
  Backwards Incompatible Change:
  * --version flag now prints out the Go version used to build the binary
  Micellaneous:
  * Various doc fixes
  * Build peco using go1.9.2.
  * There have apparently been problems running the stock peco binary in
    MacOS High Sierra, with an error message like "failed MSpanList_Insert...",
    which can averted by compiling the binary with a newer Go.

    Reports suggest that peco v0.5.1 is not affected by this problem, but
    we're making this release anyway just to make sure that we're building
    on a new-ish Go, and that users have a way to see what Go version was
    used to build their binaries

v0.5.1 - 17 Mar 2017
  Bugs/Fixes
  * When --exec is used, and you come back from the external command,
    you lost your selected location in the peco view. #410
  Backwards Incompatible Change:
  * --tty has been removed. it was not being used anyways.
  Miscellaneous
  * When scrolling right, you could potentially keep on scrolling
    infinitely. This has been addressed by #409, #412
  * External commands specified in --exec now receive
    PECO_FILENAME, PECO_LINE_COUNT, PECO_QUERY, and
    PECO_MATCHED_LINE_COUNT as environment variables
  * Removed unused structs
  * Fixed glide related Makefile actions

v0.5.0 - 06 Mar 2017
  Backwards Incompatible Change:
  * ExecuteCommand has been removed. 
  Features:
  * A new command line option `--exec` has been added. This allows you to
    execute external commands via shell, and should be used as replacement
    to `ExecuteCommand`
  * A new configuration option `MaxScanBufferSize` has been added. Whereas
    bufio.Scanner (which peco internally relies on) only accepts lines that
    are < 64kb when reading the input, specifying this option in the config
    allows you to change this limit.
    The default MaxScanBuferSize is 256kb.
  Bugs/Fixes
  * When executing external commands, the screen and the capturing of user
    input would interfere when getting back to peco.

v0.4.9 - 01 Mar 2017
  Bugs/Fixes
  * SavedSelection under `--selection-prefix` was not properly working
    (#388)
  * An outstanding bug from v0.4.0 where specifying `--query` for a large
    enough input would lose results in the first query execution has been
    fixed (#389)

v0.4.8 - 26 Feb 2017
  Features:
  * A new command line option `--on-cancel` has been added. This allows you
    to determine if the user has canceled the query, which can be useful in
    a pipeline of commands.
  * `OnCancel` does the equivalent of `--on-cancel` in the config file.
  * A new command line option `--selection-prefix` has been added. This
    allows you to use a string prefix instead of highlighting currently
    selected lines.
  * `SelectionPrefix` does the equivalent of `--selection-prefix` in the
    config file.
  Miscellaneous
  * Build using go 1.8

v0.4.7 - 17 Dec 2016
  Bugs/Fixes
  * A regression of #363 appeared again, because the test was not testing
    for the correct behavior (#376)
  Miscellaneous
  * Internal house cleaning

v0.4.6 - 14 Dec 2016
  Features:
  * A new fuzzy filter has now been added. See README for details (#369, #370)
  Bugs/Fixes
  * A very subtle timing issue that causes the search to be reset
    has been resolved (#368)

v0.4.5 - 30 Oct 2016
  Bugs/Fixes
  * v0.4.4 broke --select-1 :/ (#363)

v0.4.4 - 23 Oct 2016 
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Fix to force a redraw of the screen when the query becomes empty (#346)
  * Fix blocking when read from an slow input source is interrupted in
    the middle (#359)
  * Remove gratuitous use of panic that could happen occasionally when we
    bail out of setup (like the scenario above)

v0.4.3 - 05 Oct 2016
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Fix to apply InitialFilter setting from config file (#343)
  * Fix --buffer-size option
  * Fix --prompt option
  * Fix deadlock when certain actions are combined in the custom
    action sequence. This bug probably existed for a long time,
    but probably nobody bothered to report or didn't use the
    combinations that causes the deadlock (#345)
  * Force redraw when SelectNone/RefreshScreen is called (#346)

v0.4.2 - 23 Aug 2016
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Fix single key jump mode (#331, #332)

v0.4.1 - 21 Aug 2016
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Fix a panic that went unnoticed (#328, #329)

v0.4.0 - 19 Aug 2016
  Miscellaneous:
  * There is no real user visible change for this release
  * Build using go 1.7
  * LOTS of internal cleanup
    * Eliminated (hopefully) all of potential races
    * Remove silly embedded structs that existed all over the place
    * New pipeline mechanism should allow slightly faster filtering
    * Many fixes to properly release resources acquired by goroutines

v0.3.6 - 11 May 2016
  Features:
  * Implement way to execute arbitrary commands via ExecuteCommand config
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Fixed wrong default value for LayoutType
  * Fixed wrong (actually lack of) extension for Windows binary
  Miscellaneous:
  * Changed textual cursor representation
  * Changed dependency manager to glide
  * Changed build system to... make. Yes. Make.
  * Compile with go1.6

v0.3.5 - 30 Oct 2015
  Features:
  * Implement --select-1 option (#278)
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Do not switch lines when there's no output (#274)
  Miscellaneous:
  * Fix automatic gzip generation (#275)

v0.3.4 - 29 Sep 2015
  Features:
  * Implemented SingleKeyJump mode, a.k.a. hit-a-hint
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Fix a problem where lines were sometimes not highlighted
  * Executing a query may sometimes result in a shorter list of entries
    such that the page you were at before the query is no longer valid.
    The cursor would now move to the closest page instead of an empty buffer
  Miscellaneous:
  * Only support go1.5 (we now use cross compilation and internal packages)
  * `go run build/make.go build` will now build all of the peco release files

v0.3.3 - 11 Jul 2015
  Features:
  * Implemented ScrollLeft/ScrollRight, to read long lines
  * Implemented BackToInitialFilter, to make it easier to create combined actions
    that change the filter type
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Build properly on *BSDs

v0.3.2 - 24 Mar 2015
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Filtered results could be wrong when QueryExecutionDelay is set to 0 (#241)

v0.3.1 - 24 Mar 2015
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Regexp filter was accidentally disabled (#239/#240). Now it's back

v0.3.0 - 20 Mar 2015
  * BEWARE! 50% of the code has been rewritten!
  Features
  * Matchers are now known as Filters
  * Added StickySelection configuration option
  * Added QueryExecutionDelay configuration option
  * Added CustomFilter.BufferThreshold option
  * For Windows, an extra space at the bottom has been added to facilitate
    those users using an IM (which consumes an extra line)
  Deprecations
  * --no-ignore-case has been completely removed
  * InitialMatcher configuration option has been deprecated. Use InitialFilter
  * CustomMatcher configuration option has been deprecated. Use CustomFilter
  * RotateMatcher action has been deprecated. Use RotateFilter
  Miscellaneous
  * To enable trace logs, compile with `-tags debug`, and enable the logs
    via PECO_TRACE environment variable. e.g. `PECO_TRACE=1 peco ...`

v0.2.12 - 27 Feb 2015
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Lines with tabs didn't display properly.
  * Matches that would fail to hilight certain parts of the text
    depending on the term order
  * SelectNext/SelectPrevious actions were reversed (however, these were
    deprecated anyways)
  Miscellaneous
  * You no longer need to tap our custom tap for peco to be installed from
    homebrew.
  * Custom matcher processing is fater now

v0.2.11 - 16 Dec 2014
  Features
  * Add a InvertSelection action. Not default keymapping has been assigned
    as of this change, so you need to explicitly set one in your config file.
  * Display total entries in additin to number of pages
  * Add experimental ToggleQuery action which enables/disables the current 
    query. 
  Miscellaneous
  * Massive refactoring to avoid possible race conditions. Note that I am
    not aware of any breakage caused by previous builds of peco. Even
    without these changes you most likely did not see a race or it was
    something you could totally ignore by simply redrawing the page.
    However, since I was in the mood, and since go is awesome for providing
    us the `-race` switch, I decided to silence these warnings.
  * Fix handling of --layout option when no config file is not present.

v0.2.10 - 24 Sep 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * There was a race condition in the way status messages were cleared,
    which could leave a message to be not cleared. This has no serious
    practical impact as it's just the status message, but has been fixed.
  Miscellaneous
  * We stopped using godep because it no longer allowed us to use -copy=false.
    This should have no effect on users.
  * Update termbox-go dependency
  * Remove stdout hack

v0.2.9 - 08 Sep 2014
  Features
  * Add SmartCase matcher, which automatically toggles between case sensitive
    and insensitive modes depending on the case of your query.
  * Ctrl-l is now "peco.RefreshScreen", which basically runs the current query
    again
  Bugs/Fixes
  * User prompt is now draw *before* the filtering is executed.
  * Be more strict about checking invalid matchers.
  * Add more tests (work in progress...)

v0.2.8 - 01 Sep 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Fix in v0.2.7 was apparently not enough. Things should be fixed now.
  * Long standing bugs against DeleteForwardWord/DeleteBackwardWord have
    been fixed

v0.2.7 - 01 Sep 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * A regression introduced in v0.2.6 for DeleteForwardChar/DeleteBackwardChar 
    has been fixed
  * Some entries in the Keymap section of the README was wrong, and has
    been fixed

v0.2.6 - 30 Aug 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * --prompt option was not properly working
  Miscellaneous
  * Bunch of internal cleanups to make testing easier

v0.2.5 - 18 Aug 2014
  Features
  * Add --layout option, which allows you to switch between `top-down`
    and `bottom-up` layout mode. This is equivalent of percol's
    `--prompt-bottom --result-bottom-up`. Default is `top-down`.
    The same option can be specified in the config file as "Layout"
  Miscellaneous
  * Because of the layout option, SelectNext/SelectPrevious and
    SelectNextPage/SelectPreviousPage no longer made sense.
    Now all of these are DEPRECATED, and are aliases to different
    action names. See the README for the details.
    In particular, you would need to configure your key bindings
    using these if you want to use the `bottom-up` layout

v0.2.4 - 13 Aug 2014
  Features
  * Add --initial-matcher command line option to specify which
    matcher type to use upon start up. --no-ignore-case is deprecated
  * Add InitialMatcher option to the config file. Matcher option is
    deprecated.
  Miscellaneous
  * Binaries are now built using go1.3.1

v0.2.3 - 28 Jul 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Escape sequences are now stripped from input, so for example,
    colored output can now be fed into peco. Filtering is done against
    this stripped down buffer, but the original line is used for output.
  * Some color specification combinations caused weird color variations
    and in some worst cases caused crashes on Windows.

v0.2.2 - 23 Jul 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Fixed display of characters with ambigous width
  Features
  * on_bold style attribute has been added.

v0.2.1 - 15 Jul 2014
  Features
  * Added the ability to setup custom combined keymap. You can now
    assign multiple commands to one key sequence.
  * Key sequence that is being processed currently is displayed in the
    status message bar

v0.2.0 - 07 Jul 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Keymaps have gone through an overhaul. Hopefully it's easier for
    people who want to modify it to hack on it than before.
  * Piping multiple commands that use stdin now works properly
    (v0.1.12 was affected)
  * After multiple lines are selected, typing Enter (or "peco.Finish")
    prints out only the selected lines, and no longer adds the line where
    the cursor currently is placed on
  Features
  * --initial-index option has been added
  * --buffer-size option has been added
  * --prompt option has been added
  * Background color can now be changed
  * SelectAll/SelectNone/SelectVisible has bee added
  * Keymaps can now handle key sequences. For example, "C-x,C-c" can now
    be mapped to "peco.Cancel" for Emacs-like behavior
  * Selection by range is implemented. Now you can start a selection,
    move the cursor around, and select everything between the starting
    line and the last line the cursor was on. No default keys are available
    at this point, so assign peco.ToggleRangeMode to your favorite key

v0.1.12 - 01 Jul 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Properly report an error if specified file does not exist
  Features
  * Previously peco only read from fixed size input, but now it can
    read from streaming input such as the result of tail -f <file>.
    Do note that this buffer does take up memory, so you do not want
    to be running it for large data.

v0.1.11 - 30 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * CustoMatchers are now verified, i.e., exec.LookPath() is applied to
    the first argument to check if the command is actually executable
  * Exit code upon receiving signals are now non-zero, as it should have
    been to start with
  * Cross-compilation introduced problems with binary builds for darwin.
    This has now been fixed, but if you do get your hands on peco binaries
    before v0.1.11, don't expect it to read your config file.
  * A panic that may occur when you send new queries in very fast succession
    has been fixed for custom matchers.
  Features
  * C-c has been added to the default key binding. It causes peco to cancel
    the operation (exits with a non-zero status code)

v0.1.10 - 25 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * A panic that may occur when you send new queries in very fast succession
    has been fixed
  * Fixed the problem where Windows binaries were not able to handle Esc/Alt
    correctly

v0.1.9 - 25 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Change the base go version to build binary to 1.3

v0.1.8 - 25 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Check for terminal update errors while drawing.
  Features
  * Support Alt key prefixes to keybindings (Note: currently does not work
    on windows)

v0.1.7 - 22 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Moved repository to a Github organization: http://github.com/peco/peco
  * Because of the above change, a lot of links, imports needed fixing.
  Features:
  * Automatically set GOMAXPROCS to NumCPU. If you would like to
    avoid this behavior, you can explicitly set GOMAXPROC env var to 1
    (or whatever desired value)
  Miscellaneous
  * If you have cool uses for peco, please share them on the wiki:
    https://github.com/peco/peco/wiki/Sample-Usage

v0.1.6 - 18 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * (You know you will get a bug report only AFTER you release a
    new version :)
  * Highlighting wide characters had some issues. This has been
    there since the first release, apparently

v0.1.5 - 18 Jun 2014
  Features:
  * Add experimental --null option
  
v0.1.4 - 17 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Check for ev.Ch and ev.Key (should fix input problems)
  * Fix crashing issue on empty match
  Features:
  * In your config, setting the value to "-" will remove the
    binding.
  * Default ToggleSelect binding has been changed to
    ToggleSelectAndSelectNext

v0.1.3 - 17 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * When dealing with fast/successive user input on large buffers,
    peco was taking too long to execute queries.
  * XDG style config directories are now searched, and if all fails,
    falls back to the original ~/.peco/config.json
  * Some internal cleanup
  Features:
  * Multiple line selection has been implemented. Ctrl-Space will
    toggle the currently selected line, and peco will exit after
    printing all the selected lines. Note that on OS X, Spotlight
    by default captures these keys. You may need to reconfigure
    your settings.
  * Custom matchers via external processes have been implemented.
    See the README for more details

v0.1.2 - 16 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Multiple queries were not being match fully until the end of line
    (i.e. matches showed up correctly, but the display was not)
  * Going back to previous item from first item now pages back to last item.
  * Sending INT/TERM to peco now properly exits.
  * Some synchronization issues have been fixed (although, it would have
    never manifested itself when we were running with non-buffered channels)
  * Make sure default matcher is IgnoreCase
  Features:
  * RegExp match mode. e.g. match against "^root" or "2014-[0-9]+", etc
  * Default match mode is now configurable.
  * The entire selected line is now highlighted
  * Styles (colors and what not) can now be configured.
  * Add C-d as a default keymap for ForwardDelete
  * Add EOF handler

v0.1.1 - 12 Jun 2014
  * Fix handling malformed input (e.g. cp932 or euc-jp)
  * Make non case sensitive matching the default. C-r allows you to toggle
    between match algorithms. You can also change the default behavior
    by passing --no-ignore-case
  * Fix terminal not being updated upon executing DeleteAll
  * Fix prompt spacing
  * Add more default keymappings
  * Add peco --version

v0.1.0 - 12 Jun 2014
  * Initial versioned release
