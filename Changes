Changes
=======

v0.1.12 - 01 Jul 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Properly report an error if specified file does not exist
  Features
  * Previously peco only read from fixed size input, but now it can
    read from streaming input such as the result of tail -f <file>.
    Do note that this buffer does take up memory, so you do not want
    to be running it for large data.

v0.1.11 - 30 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * CustoMatchers are now verified, i.e., exec.LookPath() is applied to
    the first argument to check if the command is actually executable
  * Exit code upon receiving signals are now non-zero, as it should have
    been to start with
  * Cross-compilation introduced problems with binary builds for darwin.
    This has now been fixed, but if you do get your hands on peco binaries
    before v0.1.11, don't expect it to read your config file.
  * A panic that may occur when you send new queries in very fast succession
    has been fixed for custom matchers.
  Features
  * C-c has been added to the default key binding. It causes peco to cancel
    the operation (exits with a non-zero status code)

v0.1.10 - 25 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * A panic that may occur when you send new queries in very fast succession
    has been fixed
  * Fixed the problem where Windows binaries were not able to handle Esc/Alt
    correctly

v0.1.9 - 25 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Change the base go version to build binary to 1.3

v0.1.8 - 25 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes
  * Check for terminal update errors while drawing.
  Features
  * Support Alt key prefixes to keybindings (Note: currently does not work
    on windows)

v0.1.7 - 22 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Moved repository to a Github organization: http://github.com/peco/peco
  * Because of the above change, a lot of links, imports needed fixing.
  Features:
  * Automatically set GOMAXPROCS to NumCPU. If you would like to
    avoid this behavior, you can explicitly set GOMAXPROC env var to 1
    (or whatever desired value)
  Miscellaneous
  * If you have cool uses for peco, please share them on the wiki:

v0.1.6 - 18 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * (You know you will get a bug report only AFTER you release a
    new version :)
  * Highlighting wide characters had some issues. This has been
    there since the first release, apparently

v0.1.5 - 18 Jun 2014
  Features:
  * Add experimental --null option
  
v0.1.4 - 17 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Check for ev.Ch and ev.Key (should fix input problems)
  * Fix crashing issue on empty match
  Features:
  * In your config, setting the value to "-" will remove the
    binding.
  * Default ToggleSelect binding has been changed to
    ToggleSelectAndSelectNext

v0.1.3 - 17 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * When dealing with fast/successive user input on large buffers,
    peco was taking too long to execute queries.
  * XDG style config directories are now searched, and if all fails,
    falls back to the original ~/.peco/config.json
  * Some internal cleanup
  Features:
  * Multiple line selection has been implemented. Ctrl-Space will
    toggle the currently selected line, and peco will exit after
    printing all the selected lines. Note that on OS X, Spotlight
    by default captures these keys. You may need to reconfigure
    your settings.
  * Custom matchers via external processes have been implemented.
    See the README for more details

v0.1.2 - 16 Jun 2014
  Bugs/Fixes:
  * Multiple queries were not being match fully until the end of line
    (i.e. matches showed up correctly, but the display was not)
  * Going back to previous item from first item now pages back to last item.
  * Sending INT/TERM to peco now properly exits.
  * Some synchronization issues have been fixed (although, it would have
    never manifested itself when we were running with non-buffered channels)
  * Make sure default matcher is IgnoreCase
  Features:
  * RegExp match mode. e.g. match against "^root" or "2014-[0-9]+", etc
  * Default match mode is now configurable.
  * The entire selected line is now highlighted
  * Styles (colors and what not) can now be configured.
  * Add C-d as a default keymap for ForwardDelete
  * Add EOF handler

v0.1.1 - 12 Jun 2014
  * Fix handling malformed input (e.g. cp932 or euc-jp)
  * Make non case sensitive matching the default. C-r allows you to toggle
    between match algorithms. You can also change the default behavior
    by passing --no-ignore-case
  * Fix terminal not being updated upon executing DeleteAll
  * Fix prompt spacing
  * Add more default keymappings
  * Add peco --version

v0.1.0 - 12 Jun 2014
  * Initial versioned release
